# Git Workflow Best Practices

A solid Git workflow is essential for team collaboration and maintaining clean project history. Here's a comprehensive guide to Git best practices.

## Branch Naming Conventions

Follow a consistent pattern for branch names:
```bash
feature/add-user-authentication
bugfix/fix-login-validation
hotfix/security-vulnerability
release/v1.2.0
```

## Commit Messages

Write meaningful commit messages:
```bash
# Bad ❌
git commit -m "fixed stuff"

# Good ✅
git commit -m "fix: resolve user authentication timeout issue

- Increase token expiration to 24 hours
- Add refresh token mechanism
- Update tests"
```

## Git Flow Model

A typical Git flow includes these branches:

```plaintext
main
  └── develop
       ├── feature/user-auth
       ├── feature/payment-integration
       └── bugfix/validation-error
```

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Feature
```bash
# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

### Keeping Feature Branch Updated
```bash
# While on feature branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

### Preparing for Pull Request
```bash
# Squash commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Squash last 3 commits

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

## Advanced Git Commands

### Stashing Changes
```bash
# Save work in progress
git stash save "work in progress on auth feature"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply specific stash
git stash apply stash@{0}
```

### Interactive Rebase
```bash
# Rewrite last 3 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Commands in rebase:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit but edit message
# s, squash = use commit but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like squash but discard commit message
```

## Best Practices

1. Never rewrite public history
2. Keep commits atomic and focused
3. Use meaningful branch names
4. Write descriptive commit messages
5. Regular rebasing instead of merging
6. Delete branches after merging

## Git Aliases for Productivity

Add these to your `.gitconfig`:
```bash
[alias]
  st = status
  co = checkout
  br = branch
  ci = commit
  unstage = reset HEAD --
  last = log -1 HEAD
  lg = log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit
```

Remember: A good Git workflow makes collaboration smoother and helps maintain a clean, meaningful project history.
